## approch 1

- sort the array
- traverse from end and get first element smaller than the last element
- time complexity - O(n log n)
- space complexity - O(1)

## approch 2

- traverse the array two times
- one time get largest element
- second time get element smaller than current but greater than all
- time complexity - O(n)
- auxiliary space - O(1)
